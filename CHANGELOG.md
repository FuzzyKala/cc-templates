- Complete template system for cross-project use
- 12 specialist agent templates with template variables
- 4 project type configurations (Web Frontend, Mobile App, AI/ML, Backend API)
- Rolling window documentation system
- Automated session management commands (`/ready` and `/recap`)
- Interactive setup script (`init-project.sh`)
- Comprehensive documentation and setup guide

### System Evolution History

This system evolved through practical use on the OKINIIRI Market Frontend project:

#### Session 1-2 (2025-09-04 to 2025-09-04)
- **Initial Creation**: Basic agent system and workflow protocols
- **Early Implementation**: 6 specialized agents with varying detail levels
- **Lessons**: Identified inconsistencies and over-specification issues

#### Session 3 (2025-09-06) 
- **Major Breakthrough**: Agent system standardization
- **Dramatic Simplification**: Reduced over-detailed agents by 75-85%
  - frontend-engineer.md: 347 → 60 lines (83% reduction)
  - ui-ux-designer.md: 349 → 59 lines (83% reduction)
  - product-manager.md: 240 → 59 lines (75% reduction)
- **Format Alignment**: Standardized 7-section structure across all agents
- **Philosophy Shift**: From rigid processes to adaptive, context-driven coordination

#### Session 4-6 (2025-09-06 to 2025-09-07)
- **Practical Application**: Real-world testing and refinement
- **Workflow Violations**: Identified and addressed delegation anti-patterns
- **Quality Improvements**: Enhanced session end protocols
- **User Experience**: Improved footer design, navigation fixes, responsive layouts

#### Session 7 (2025-09-08)
- **Rolling Window Innovation**: Solved documentation growth problem
- **Archive System**: Implemented session-history.md with automatic management
- **Command Enhancement**: Updated `/ready` and `/recap` for rolling window architecture
- **Scalability**: Achieved sustainable documentation system (150-180 lines vs 300+)

#### Session 8 (2025-09-08)
- **Generalization**: Transformed project-specific system to universal templates
- **Template Variables**: Added comprehensive variable system for cross-project use
- **Project Types**: Created 4 project type configurations with specialized agent sets
- **Distribution**: Created user-scoped system at `~/.claude-templates/`

### Key Design Principles Discovered

1. **Simplicity Over Completeness**: 60-line clear agents work better than 300-line specifications
2. **Context-Driven Over Template-Driven**: Rigid processes hinder effectiveness
3. **Flexible Expertise Over Prescriptive Functions**: Agents provide domain expertise, not scripts
4. **Adaptive Coordination Over Fixed Workflows**: Most tasks need 1-2 agents, not complex chains

### Architecture Decisions

- **Rolling Window Documentation**: Maintains current + last 2 sessions for immediate context
- **Complete History Preservation**: Full session details archived automatically
- **Agent Specialization**: Clear domain boundaries with flexible methodology
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in review processes without bureaucratic overhead
- **Cross-Project Learning**: Knowledge transfer and continuous improvement
