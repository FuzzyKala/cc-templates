*A streamlined, proven system for systematic multi-agent development with Claude Code*

**Transform chaotic AI assistance into systematic, high-quality development workflows**

</div>

## 🎯 What Is This?

This system evolved through **7 real development sessions**, transforming from over-engineering to elegant simplicity. It provides:

- **Intelligent Agent Coordination**: 5 core specialist agents that handle complex development tasks
- **Automated Project Setup**: One command (`/setup-agents`) sets up everything based on your project type  
- **Focused Session Management**: Rolling documentation that prevents information overload
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in review processes ensure consistent, high-quality deliverables

### The Problem It Solves
- **Lost Context**: Sessions start from scratch, losing project understanding
- **Inconsistent Quality**: No systematic approach to code review and validation  
- **Ad-hoc Coordination**: Random task handling instead of structured specialist delegation
- **Documentation Bloat**: Project files become unwieldy and lose focus

### The Solution
- **Intelligent Setup**: Auto-detects project type and configures optimal agents in 5 minutes
- **Specialist Coordination**: 5 core agents handle all development domains effectively
- **Session Management**: `/ready` and `/recap` commands handle context and progress
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in review processes maintain standards

## 🔄 Migrating from v1 to v2

**If you have an existing project with cc-templates v1:**

### Automatic Version Detection
**The system now automatically detects your version:**

```bash
# 1. Update the global templates
cd ~/.claude-templates
git pull origin main

# 2. Run setup - system detects version automatically
cd your-existing-project  
/setup-agents

# System will show:
# "v1 installation detected! This will upgrade to v2..."
# or "v2 already installed. This will refresh your setup..."
```

### Manual Backup (Optional)
```bash
# If you want to backup before upgrading:
cd your-existing-project
cp -r .claude .claude-v1-backup
```

### v1 → v2 Agent Changes
**Old agents are replaced by 5 core agents:**
- `fullstack-engineer` → `implementation-specialist`
- `ui-ux-designer` → `design-specialist`  
- `code-reviewer` → `quality-specialist`
- `testing-specialist` → `quality-specialist`
- `deployment-engineer` → `deployment-specialist`

**Your CLAUDE.md will be recreated** with the new template structure.

## 🤝 Best Practices

### Getting Started
1. **Use auto-detection first** - Let the system configure optimal agents
2. **Validate setup** - Always run `/ready --validate` after setup
3. **Start simple** - Begin with small tasks to understand agent coordination
4. **Customize gradually** - Adapt agents to your specific project needs

### Effective Sessions  
1. **Begin with `/ready`** - Complete project context and agent overview
2. **Delegate complex work** - Use specialists rather than handling directly
3. **Use quality gates** - Have quality-specialist validate important changes
4. **End with `/recap`** - Document progress and maintain session history

### Team Coordination
1. **Shared setup** - One team member runs setup, everyone benefits
2. **Consistent standards** - Agents provide uniform quality gates
3. **Knowledge sharing** - Session history preserves team learning
4. **Onboarding acceleration** - New members get immediate context

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### **Setup Problems**
```bash
# Problem: Auto-detection failed
Solution: /setup-agents --interactive

# Problem: Existing .claude/ directory conflicts  
Solution: /setup-agents --backup-first

# Problem: Template variables not replaced
Solution: Re-run /setup-agents to complete setup
```

#### **Usage Problems**
```bash
# Problem: Agents don't understand project context
Solution: Update CLAUDE.md and use /ready at session start

# Problem: Quality issues with agent work
Solution: Provide clearer context when delegating tasks

# Problem: Documentation getting too long
Solution: Use /recap regularly to maintain focused sessions
```

### Getting Help
- **Validation**: Use `/ready --validate` for setup verification
- **Context**: Ensure CLAUDE.md reflects current project state  
- **Documentation**: Check `.claude/sessions/` for historical context
- **Updates**: Update global templates with `cd ~/.claude-templates && git pull`
