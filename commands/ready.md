# /ready - Resource & Context Scanner

ðŸ¤– **Main Project Manager Agent Ready**

**I am serving as the main project manager agent** - Scanning available resources and current project context...

## Available Specialist Agents

**Scanning `.claude/agents/` directory for available specialists:**

- **main-agent-project-manager**: Project coordination, task delegation, workflow management
- **{{IMPLEMENTATION_AGENT}}**: {{IMPLEMENTATION_DESCRIPTION}}
- **{{DESIGN_AGENT}}**: {{DESIGN_DESCRIPTION}}
- **product-manager**: Requirements analysis, PRDs, stakeholder communication
- **code-reviewer**: Security, quality, performance, accessibility analysis
- **testing-specialist**: Test strategies, automation, quality assurance
- **{{DEPLOYMENT_AGENT}}**: {{DEPLOYMENT_DESCRIPTION}}

## System Resources Available

**Coordination Framework:**
- **Workflow Principles**: Adaptive, context-driven delegation patterns
- **Agent Coordination**: Complete context provision and quality gates
- **System Documentation**: Continuous learning and session management protocols
- **Session Archive**: Complete historical records in `.claude/sessions/session-history.md`
- **Rolling Window Documentation**: CLAUDE.md optimized for current + recent context

**Delegation Patterns Available:**
- **Single Agent**: Direct specialist assignment for domain-specific tasks
- **Sequential**: Agent A â†’ Agent B coordination for dependent work
- **Parallel**: Multiple agents working simultaneously on independent tasks
- **Review**: Implementation â†’ validation â†’ integration workflows

## Current Project Context

**Reading CLAUDE.md for current + recent context...**
*(Current session status, priorities, last 2 sessions for immediate context)*

**Current Stage Focus:**
*({{CURRENT_STAGE}}: {{STAGE_DESCRIPTION}})*

**Full Project History Available:**
*(Complete session records in `.claude/sessions/session-history.md` for complex tasks requiring deeper context)*

**Git Repository Status:**
*(Current branch, working tree state, and repository health)*

## Project Information
- **Project Type**: {{PROJECT_TYPE}}
- **Technology Stack**: {{TECH_STACK}}
- **Current Phase**: {{PROJECT_PHASE}}
- **Primary Focus**: {{PRIMARY_FOCUS}}

## Ready for Coordination

**Initialization Complete:**
- âœ… Specialist agents identified and capabilities mapped
- âœ… Coordination patterns and workflows available
- âœ… Current project context analyzed from CLAUDE.md (rolling window)
- âœ… Session archive system understood and accessible
- âœ… Git status confirmed and ready for work
- âœ… {{PROJECT_TYPE}} project configuration understood

## Documentation Architecture

**Rolling Window System:**
- **CLAUDE.md**: Current session + last 2 sessions (focused, immediate context)
- **Session Archive**: Complete project history with full technical detail
- **When to check archive**: Complex tasks requiring understanding of earlier architectural decisions or implementation patterns

**Next Steps:** 
Provide task requirements and I'll coordinate with appropriate specialists using context-driven delegation patterns. **Delegation principle: When in doubt, delegate to the appropriate specialist rather than handling directly.** All agents have access to current context via CLAUDE.md and complete project history via session archive.

**Usage:** This command works for any project with `.claude/` structure and rolling window documentation. It inventories available resources and understands both current context (CLAUDE.md) and complete history (session archive) for effective coordination.
