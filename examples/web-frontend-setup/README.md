## Configuration Example

### CLAUDE.md (After Customization)
```markdown
# My Awesome Web App - Project Status

## Current Session Status
- **Last Updated**: 2024-09-08 (Session 1)  
- **Project Status**: 10% Complete (1/7 stages done)
- **Active Stage**: Foundation & Setup
- **Tech Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS

## Development Status

### ✅ COMPLETED STAGES (1/7)
1. **Foundation & Setup** ✅ - Next.js project initialized, Claude system configured

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS (1/7)  
2. **Component Architecture** 🔄 - Setting up design system and core components

### ⏳ PENDING (5/7)
3. **Core Features** ⏳ - Main application features
4. **UI/UX Polish** ⏳ - Visual design and user experience
5. **Testing & QA** ⏳ - Automated testing and quality assurance
6. **Performance** ⏳ - Performance optimization and monitoring  
7. **Deployment** ⏳ - Production deployment and monitoring
```

## Agent Configuration

### Frontend Engineer Agent
```markdown
# Core Responsibilities
- **React/Next.js Development**: Modern hooks, SSR/SSG, performance optimization
- **Component Architecture**: Scalable design systems and reusable components
- **TypeScript Integration**: Type-safe development with advanced patterns
```

### UI/UX Designer Agent  
```markdown
# Delegation Triggers
- Visual design and layout for web applications
- Component design system development
- Responsive design implementation
- Web accessibility improvements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
```

## Session Flow Example

### Session Start with `/ready`
```
🤖 Main Project Manager Agent Ready

Available Specialist Agents:
- frontend-engineer: React/Next.js development, component architecture
- ui-ux-designer: Web UI design, responsive layouts, accessibility
- code-reviewer: Code quality, security, performance analysis
- testing-specialist: Unit/integration/E2E testing for web apps
- deployment-engineer: Vercel/Netlify deployment, web infrastructure

Current Project Context:
- Project Type: Web Frontend
- Technology Stack: React 18, TypeScript, Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS
- Current Stage: Component Architecture
- Git Status: Clean, ready for development
```

### Work Session
```
User: "I need to create a responsive navigation component with mobile menu"

Main Agent: I'll coordinate with the UI/UX designer for the design approach, 
then the frontend engineer for React implementation.

[Delegates to ui-ux-designer for responsive navigation design]
[Delegates to frontend-engineer for React component implementation]
[Coordinates with testing-specialist for component testing]
[Reviews with code-reviewer for quality validation]
```

### Session End with `/recap`
```
Session 2 Achievements (2024-09-08):
✅ Navigation Component: Responsive navigation with mobile hamburger menu
✅ Design System: Established component patterns and Tailwind config
✅ Testing Setup: Jest and React Testing Library configuration

Session 2 Technical Framework:
- Component Architecture: Atomic design principles with TypeScript
- Responsive System: Mobile-first Tailwind CSS breakpoints
- State Management: React hooks with custom navigation hook

Session 2 Lessons Learned:
✅ Effective Pattern: UI/UX → Frontend → Testing coordination worked smoothly
✅ Technical Insight: Mobile-first approach reduced CSS complexity
⚠️ Challenge Resolved: TypeScript strict mode required prop interface refinement
```

## Quality Gates Example

### Code Review Validation
```markdown
**Quality Standards Met:**
- ✅ Component follows React best practices
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces properly defined
- ✅ Responsive design tested across breakpoints  
- ✅ Accessibility attributes included (ARIA labels)
- ✅ Unit tests written with 90%+ coverage
- ✅ Performance optimized (React.memo, lazy loading)
```

### Testing Specialist Output
```markdown
**Testing Coverage:**
- Unit Tests: Navigation component behavior
- Integration Tests: Navigation with routing
- Accessibility Tests: Keyboard navigation, screen readers
- Visual Tests: Responsive breakpoint validation
- E2E Tests: Mobile menu interaction flow
```

## Benefits Demonstrated

### Before Claude System
- Manual coordination between design and development
- Inconsistent quality standards
- Lost context between sessions
- No systematic approach to agent delegation

### After Claude System  
- **Structured Coordination**: Clear delegation to appropriate specialists
- **Quality Gates**: Built-in review processes ensure standards
- **Context Preservation**: Rolling window maintains project history
- **Continuous Learning**: Patterns captured and reused
- **Session Management**: Smooth handoffs between work sessions

## Metrics

### Development Velocity
- **Setup Time**: 5 minutes with installation script
- **Context Switching**: Eliminated with `/ready` command  
- **Documentation Overhead**: Automated with `/recap` command
- **Quality Issues**: Reduced through systematic specialist review

### Team Coordination
- **Delegation Clarity**: Clear triggers for when to use each agent
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Complete session history preserved
- **Standards Consistency**: Quality gates applied systematically
- **Learning Application**: Successful patterns documented and reused

This example demonstrates how the Claude Session Management System transforms ad-hoc development coordination into a systematic, high-quality process that scales across projects and team members.
